# ðŸš€ Meraki Network Monitoring & Automation Framework

This project simulates a real-world network automation use case using the **Cisco Meraki Dashboard API**, Python scripting, and CI/CD practices. It is designed for hands-on learning, automation portfolio building, and can be extended for enterprise integration.
